## Initial Setup
After cloning your new repo locally, run the interactive setup script:

```bash
npm run setup
```

This handles all renaming, rebranding, and configuration automatically:
- Renames the theme directory, translation files, and all references
- Performs case-sensitive find-and-replace across all project files
- Updates Lando config, deploy scripts, and CI workflows
- Generates a project-specific `AGENTS.md` for AI-assisted development
- Optionally runs `npm install` and `lando start`

For CI or non-interactive use: `npm run setup -- --yes`
To preview changes: `npm run setup -- --dry-run`

## Global Styles Setup

This starter theme relies on theme.json variables and SCSS variables and mixins to set up global styles.
Run the design-system CLI command to choose how you want to configure them:

```bash
npm run design-system
```

You will see three options:

1. **Set variables in the terminal**: Interactive prompts walk through variables setup.
2. **Set variables manually**: Opens the variable mapping guide at `docs/variable-mapping.md`.
3. **Figma auto sync (beta)**: Simply paste a Figma design URL and hit Enter. Extraction quality depends on the Figma design's consistency and structure.

Setting up these variables will make most of the global elements such as headings, buttons, color palette etc. work out of the box, fluid responsive, Gutenberg compatible, looking same in frontend and editor, and easy to maintain and scale because everything comes from a single source of truth - variables and mixins.
